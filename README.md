# Debugging Duck MOBILE

This is my first React Native Cross Platform Mobile Application, a port of my first Electron Desktop app featuring a cute rubber duck that helps you debug your code. Explain your code to the duck and it will help you find the bugs!

_If you want to read the origin of the debugging duck_: [Rubber duck debugging - wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging)

## BEWARE: Work still in progress 👷‍♂️ - not ready!!! ⛔️
